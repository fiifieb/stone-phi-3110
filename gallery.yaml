  A RISC-V assembly emulator built from the ground up in OCaml, designed to parse, decode, 
  and execute real RISC-V instructions in a clean, modular pipeline. Our system loads 
  text-based assembly programs, simulates register and program-counter state, 
  and executes arithmetic, logic, move, shift, and immediate operations according to 
  the RISC-V specification. Users can supply initial register values, step through instruction execution, 
  and observe register changes in real time in a graphical user interface.
